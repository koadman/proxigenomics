Version 1.2
-----------

The change from 1.1 is only w.r.t weighted graphs. The weight of
the self-loop that is added to each node before clustering is now
set to be the maximum of the weights of the node to any of its
neighbors (earlier it was hard-coded to be 1). 

Also, mergeClusters and the tools directory are new additions.
