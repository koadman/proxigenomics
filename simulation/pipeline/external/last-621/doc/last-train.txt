last-train
==========

This script tries to find suitable score parameters (substitution and
gap scores) for aligning some given sequences.

It (probabilistically) aligns the sequences using some initial score
parameters, then estimates better score parameters based on the
alignments, and repeats this procedure until the parameters stop
changing.

The usage is like this::

  lastdb mydb reference.fasta
  last-train mydb queries.fasta

last-train prints a summary of each alignment step, followed by the
final score parameters in a format that can be read by lastal's -p
option.

Options
-------

  -h, --help
         Show a help message, with default option values, and exit.

Training options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  --revsym
         Force the substitution scores to have reverse-complement
         symmetry, e.g. score(A→G) = score(T→C).  This is often
         appropriate, if neither strand is "special".
  --matsym
         Force the substitution scores to have directional symmetry,
         e.g. score(A→G) = score(G→A).
  --gapsym
         Force the insertion costs to equal the deletion costs.
  --pid=PID
         Ignore alignments with > PID% identity.  This aims to
         optimize the parameters for low-similarity alignments,
         similarly to the BLOSUM matrices.

Initial parameter options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -r SCORE   Initial match score.
  -q COST    Initial mismatch cost.
  -p NAME    Initial match/mismatch score matrix.
  -a COST    Initial gap existence cost.
  -b COST    Initial gap extension cost.
  -A COST    Initial insertion existence cost.
  -B COST    Initial insertion extension cost.

Alignment options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -D LENGTH  Query letters per random alignment.
  -E EG2     Maximum expected alignments per square giga.
  -T NUMBER  Type of alignment: 0=local, 1=overlap.
  -Q NUMBER  Query sequence format: 0=fasta, 1=fastq-sanger.
             **Important:** if you use option -Q, last-train will only
             train the gap scores, and leave the substitution scores
             at their initial values.

Bugs
----

* last-train assumes that gap lengths roughly follow a geometric
  distribution.  If they do not (which is often the case), the results
  may be poor.

* last-train can fail for various reasons, e.g. if the sequences are
  too dissimilar.
