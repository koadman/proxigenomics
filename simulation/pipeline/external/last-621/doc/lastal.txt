lastal
======

This program finds local alignments between query sequences, and
reference sequences that have been prepared using lastdb.  You can use
it like this::

  lastdb humanDb humanChromosome*.fasta
  lastal humanDb dna*.fasta > myalns.maf

The lastdb command reads files called ``humanChromosome*.fasta`` and
writes several files whose names begin with ``humanDb``.  The lastal
command reads files called ``dna*.fasta``, compares them to
``humanDb``, and writes alignments to a file called ``myalns.maf``.

You can also pipe query sequences into lastal, for example::

  zcat seqs.fasta.gz | lastal humanDb > myalns.maf

Steps in lastal
---------------

1) Find similar regions

  a) Find initial matches.  For each possible start position in the
     query: find the shortest match with length ≥ l that *either*
     occurs ≤ m times in the reference, *or* has length L.

  b) Extend a gapless alignment from each initial match, and keep
     those with score ≥ d.

  c) Define cores: find the longest run of identical matches in each
     gapless alignment.

  d) Extend a gapped alignment from either side of each core, and keep
     those with score ≥ e.

2) Align them

  e) "Final" alignments: extend gapped alignments again, but with
     different masking and/or maximum score drop parameters.  This
     step is performed only if u=2 or if z differs from x.

  f) Non-redundantize the alignments: if several alignments share an
     endpoint (same coordinates in both sequences), remove all but one
     highest-scoring one.

  g) Estimate the ambiguity of each aligned column (OFF by default).

  h) Redo the alignments to minimize column ambiguity, using either
     gamma-centroid or LAMA (OFF by default).

Options

Cosmetic Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -h, --help
      Show all options and their default settings, and exit.

  -V, --version
      Show version information, and exit.

  -v  Be verbose: write messages about what lastal is doing.

  -f NUMBER
      Choose the output format: 0 means tabular and 1 means MAF.  MAF
      format looks like this::

        a score=15 EG2=4.7e+04 E=2.6e-05
        s chr3 9 23 + 939557 TTTGGGAGTTGAAGTTTTCGCCC
        s seqA 2 21 +     25 TTTGGGAGTTGAAGGTT--GCCC

      Lines starting with "s" contain: the sequence name, the start
      coordinate of the alignment, the number of sequence letters
      spanned by the alignment, the strand, the sequence length, and
      the aligned letters.  The start coordinates are zero-based.  If
      the strand is "-", the start coordinate is in the reverse
      strand.

      The same alignment in tabular format looks like this::

        15 chr3 9 23 + 939557 seqA 2 21 + 25 17,2:0,4 EG2=4.7e+04 E=2.6e-05

      The "17,2:0,4" shows the sizes and offsets of gapless blocks in
      the alignment.  In this case, we have a block of size 17, then
      an offset of size 2 in the upper sequence and 0 in the lower
      sequence, then a block of size 4.

Score Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -r SCORE
      Match score.

  -q COST
      Mismatch cost.

  -p NAME
      Specify a match/mismatch score matrix.  Options -r and -q will
      be ignored.  The built-in matrices are described in
      `<last-matrices.html>`_.

      Any other NAME is assumed to be a file name.  For an example of
      the format, see the matrix files in the data directory.  Any
      letters that aren't in the matrix will get the lowest score in
      the matrix when aligned to anything.  Asymmetric scores are
      allowed: query letters correspond to columns and reference
      letters correspond to rows.  Other options can be specified on
      lines starting with "#last", but command line options override
      them.

  -a COST
      Gap existence cost.

  -b COST
      Gap extension cost.  A gap of size k costs: a + (b × k).

  -A COST
      Insertion existence cost.  This refers to insertions in the
      query relative to the reference.  If -A is not used, the
      insertion existence cost will equal the deletion existence cost,
      which is set by -a.

  -B COST
      Insertion extension cost.

  -c COST
      This option allows use of "generalized affine gap costs" (SF
      Altschul 1998, Proteins 32(1):88-96).  Here, a "gap" may consist
      of unaligned regions of both sequences.  If these unaligned
      regions have sizes j and k, where j ≤ k, the cost is: a +
      b⋅(k-j) + c⋅j.  If c ≥ a + 2b (the default), it reduces to
      standard affine gaps.

  -F COST
      Align DNA queries to protein reference sequences, using the
      specified frameshift cost.  A value of 15 seems to be
      reasonable.  The output looks like this::

        a score=108
        s prot 2  40 + 649 FLLQAVKLQDP-STPHQIVPSP-VSDLIATHTLCPRMKYQDD
        s dna  8 117 + 999 FFLQ-IKLWDP\STPH*IVSSP/PSDLISAHTLCPRMKSQDN

      The ``\`` indicates a forward shift by one nucleotide, and the
      ``/`` indicates a reverse shift by one nucleotide.  The ``*``
      indicates a stop codon.  The same alignment in tabular format
      looks like this::

        108 prot 2 40 + 649 dna 8 117 + 999 4,1:0,6,0:1,10,0:-1,19

      The "-1" indicates the reverse frameshift.

  -x DROP
      Maximum score drop for gapped alignments.  Gapped alignments are
      forbidden from having any internal region with score < -DROP.
      This serves two purposes: accuracy (avoid spurious internal
      regions in alignments) and speed (the smaller the faster).

  -y DROP
      Maximum score drop for gapless alignments.

  -z DROP
      Maximum score drop for final gapped alignments.

  -d SCORE
      Minimum score for gapless alignments.

  -e SCORE
      Minimum alignment score.  (If you do gapless alignment with
      option -j1, then -d and -e mean the same thing.  If you set
      both, -e will prevail.)

E-value options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -D LENGTH
      Report alignments that are expected by chance at most once per
      LENGTH query letters.  This option only affects the default
      value of -E, so if you specify -E then -D has no effect.

  -E THRESHOLD
      Maximum EG2 (expected alignments per square giga).  This option
      only affects the default value of -e, so if you specify -e then
      -E has no effect.

Miscellaneous Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  -s STRAND
      Specify which query strand should be used: 0 means reverse only,
      1 means forward only, and 2 means both.

  -T NUMBER
      Type of alignment: 0 means "local alignment" and 1 means
      "overlap alignment".  Local alignments can end anywhere in the
      middle or at the ends of the sequences.  Overlap alignments must
      extend to the left until they hit the end of a sequence (either
      query or reference), and to the right until they hit the end of
      a sequence.

  -m MULTIPLICITY
      Maximum multiplicity for initial matches.  Each initial match is
      lengthened until it occurs at most this many times in the
      reference.

      If the reference was split into volumes by lastdb, then lastal
      uses one volume at a time.  The maximum multiplicity then
      applies to each volume, not the whole reference.  This is why
      voluming changes the results.

  -l LENGTH
      Minimum length for initial matches.  Length means the number of
      letters spanned by the match.

  -L LENGTH
      Maximum length for initial matches.

  -n COUNT
      Maximum number of gapless alignments per query position.  When
      lastal extends gapless alignments from initial matches that
      start at one query position, if it gets COUNT successful
      extensions, it skips any remaining initial matches starting at
      that position.

  -C LIMIT
      Culling limit for gapless alignments.  Before extending gapped
      alignments, discard any gapless alignment whose query
      coordinates lie in those of LIMIT or more others with higher
      score-per-length.

  -k STEP
      Look for initial matches starting only at every STEP-th position
      in the query.  This makes lastal faster but less sensitive.

  -i BYTES
      Search queries in batches of at most this many bytes.  If a
      single sequence exceeds this amount, however, it is not split.
      You can use suffixes K, M, and G to specify KibiBytes,
      MebiBytes, and GibiBytes.  This option has no effect on the
      results (apart from their order), unless k>1.

      If the reference was split into volumes by lastdb, then each
      volume will be read into memory once per query batch.

  -R DIGITS
      Specify lowercase-marking of repeats, by two digits (e.g. "-R 01"),
      with the following meanings.

      First digit:

      0. Convert the input sequences to uppercase while reading them.
      1. Keep any lowercase in the input sequences.

      Second digit:

      0. Do not check for simple repeats.
      1. Convert simple repeats (e.g. cacacacacacacacac) to lowercase.
      2. Convert simple repeats, within AT-rich DNA, to lowercase.

      Details: Tantan is applied separately to forward and reverse
      strands.  For DNA-versus-protein alignment (option -F), it is
      applied to the DNA after translation, at the protein level.

  -u NUMBER
      Specify treatment of lowercase letters when extending
      alignments.  0 means do not mask them; 1 means mask them for
      gapless extensions; 2 means mask them for gapless and gapped
      extensions but not final extensions; 3 means mask them at all
      stages.  "Mask" means change their match/mismatch scores to
      min(unmasked score, 0).  This option does not affect treatment
      of lowercase for initial matches.

  -w DISTANCE
      This option is a kludge to avoid catastrophic time and memory
      usage when self-comparing a large sequence.  If the sequence
      contains a tandem repeat, we may get a gapless alignment that is
      slightly offset from the main self-alignment.  In that case, the
      gapped extension might "discover" the main self-alignment and
      extend over the entire length of the sequence.

      To avoid this problem, gapped alignments are not triggered from
      any gapless alignment that:

      * is contained, in both sequences, in the "core" of another
        alignment
      * has start coordinates offset by DISTANCE or less relative to
        this core

      Use -w0 to turn this off.

  -G FILE
      Use an alternative genetic code in the specified file.  For an
      example of the format, see vertebrateMito.gc in the examples
      directory.  By default, the standard genetic code is used.  This
      option has no effect unless DNA-versus-protein alignment is
      selected with option -F.

  -t TEMPERATURE
      Parameter for converting between scores and likelihood ratios.
      This affects the column ambiguity estimates.  A score is
      converted to a likelihood ratio by this formula: exp(score /
      TEMPERATURE).  The default value is 1/lambda, where lambda is
      the scale factor of the scoring matrix, which is calculated by
      the method of Yu and Altschul (YK Yu et al. 2003, PNAS
      100(26):15688-93).

  -g GAMMA
      This option affects gamma-centroid and LAMA alignment only.

      Gamma-centroid alignments minimize the ambiguity of paired
      letters.  In fact, this method aligns letters whose column error
      probability is less than GAMMA/(GAMMA+1).  When GAMMA is low, it
      aligns confidently-paired letters only, so there tend to be many
      unaligned letters.  When GAMMA is high, it aligns letters more
      liberally.

      LAMA (Local Alignment Metric Accuracy) alignments minimize the
      ambiguity of columns (both paired letters and gap columns).
      When GAMMA is low, this method produces shorter alignments with
      more-confident columns, and when GAMMA is high it produces
      longer alignments including less-confident columns.

      In summary: to get the most accurately paired letters, use
      gamma-centroid.  To get accurately placed gaps, use LAMA.

      Note that the reported alignment score is that of the ordinary
      gapped alignment before realigning with gamma-centroid or LAMA.

  -j NUMBER
      Output type: 0 means counts of initial matches (of all lengths);
      1 means gapless alignments; 2 means gapped alignments before
      non-redundantization; 3 means gapped alignments after
      non-redundantization; 4 means alignments with ambiguity
      estimates; 5 means gamma-centroid alignments; 6 means LAMA
      alignments; 7 means alignments with expected counts.

      If you use -j0, lastal will count the number of initial matches,
      per length, per query sequence.  Options -l and -L will set the
      minimum and maximum lengths, and -m will be ignored.  If you
      compare a large sequence to itself with -j0, it's wise to set
      option -L.

      If you use j>3, each alignment will get a "fullScore" (also
      known as "forward score" or "sum-of-paths score").  This is like
      the score, but it takes into account alternative alignments.

      If you use -j7, lastal will print an extra MAF line starting
      with "c" for each alignment.  The first 16 numbers on this line
      are the expected counts of matches and mismatches: first the
      count of reference As aligned to query As, then the count of
      reference As aligned to query Cs, and so on.  For proteins there
      will be 400 such numbers.  The final ten numbers are expected
      counts related to gaps.  They are:

      * The count of matches plus mismatches.  (This may exceed the
        total of the preceding numbers, if the sequences have non-ACGT
        letters.)
      * The count of deleted letters.
      * The count of inserted letters.
      * The count of delete opens (= count of delete closes).
      * The count of insert opens (= count of insert closes).
      * The count of adjacent pairs of insertions and deletions.

      The final four numbers are always zero, unless you use
      generalized affine gap costs.  They are:

      * The count of unaligned letter pairs.
      * The count of unaligned letter pair opens (= count of closes).
      * The count of adjacent pairs of deletions and unaligned letter pairs.
      * The count of adjacent pairs of insertions and unaligned letter pairs.

  -Q NUMBER
      This option allows lastal to use sequence quality scores, or
      PSSMs, for the queries.  0 means read queries in fasta format
      (without quality scores); 1 means fastq-sanger format; 2 means
      fastq-solexa format; 3 means fastq-illumina format; 4 means prb
      format; 5 means read PSSMs.  (Warning: Illumina data is not
      necessarily in fastq-illumina format; it is often in
      fastq-sanger format.)

      The fastq formats look like this::

        @mySequenceName
        TTTTTTTTGCCTCGGGCCTGAGTTCTTAGCCGCG
        +
        55555555*&5-/55*5//5(55,5#&$)$)*+$

      The "+" may optionally be followed by a name (ignored), and the
      sequence and quality codes are allowed to wrap onto more than
      one line.  For fastq-sanger, the quality scores are obtained by
      subtracting 33 from the ASCII values of the characters below the
      "+".  For fastq-solexa and fastq-illumina, they are obtained by
      subtracting 64.

      prb format stores four quality scores (A, C, G, T) per position,
      with one sequence per line, like this::

        -40  40 -40 -40      -12   1 -12  -3      -10  10 -40 -40

      Since prb does not store sequence names, lastal uses the line
      number (starting from 1) as the name.

      In fastq-sanger and fastq-illumina format, the quality scores
      are related to error probabilities like this: qScore =
      -10⋅log10[p].  In fastq-solexa and prb, however, qScore =
      -10⋅log10[p/(1-p)].  In lastal's MAF output, the quality scores
      are written on lines starting with "q".  For fastq, they are
      written with the same encoding as the input.  For prb, they are
      written in the fastq-solexa (ASCII-64) encoding.

      Finally, PSSM means "position-specific scoring matrix".  The
      format is::

        myLovelyPSSM
             A  R  N  D  C  Q  E  G  H  I  L  K  M  F  P  S  T  W  Y  V
        1 M -2 -2 -3 -4 -2 -1 -3 -3 -2  1  2 -2  8 -1 -3 -2 -1 -2 -2  0
        2 S  0 -2  0  1  3 -1 -1 -1 -2 -3 -3 -1 -2 -3 -2  5  0 -4 -3 -2
        3 D -1 -2  0  7 -4 -1  1 -2 -2 -4 -4 -2 -4 -4 -2 -1 -2 -5 -4 -4

      The sequence appears in the second column, and columns 3 onwards
      contain the position-specific scores.  Any letters not specified
      by any column will get the lowest score in each row.  This
      format is a simplified version of PSI-BLAST's ASCII format: the
      non-simplified version is allowed too.

      Warning: lastal cannot directly calculate E-values for PSSMs.
      The E-values (and the default value of -y) are determined by the
      otherwise-unused match and mismatch scores (options -r -q and
      -p).  There is evidence these E-values will be accurate if the
      PSSM is "constructed to the same scale" as the match/mismatch
      scores (SF Altschul et al. 1997, NAR 25(17):3389-402).

Parallelization and Memory Sharing
----------------------------------

If you run several lastal jobs at the same time on the same computer,
using the same set of reference files prepared by lastdb, then they
will share memory for the reference files.

Multiple volumes
----------------

If lastdb creates multiple volumes::

  lastdb hugeDb huge.fasta

You can either run lastal on the whole thing::

  lastal hugeDb queries.fasta > myalns.maf

Or on one volume at a time::

  lastal hugeDb0 queries.fasta > myalns0.maf
  lastal hugeDb1 queries.fasta > myalns1.maf
  lastal hugeDb2 queries.fasta > myalns2.maf

The former method reads the queries in large batches, and aligns each
batch to one volume at a time.  If you run several jobs in parallel,
they will not necessarily use the same volume at the same time.

Therefore, for parallelization, you should either ensure you have
enough memory to hold several volumes simultaneously, or run lastal on
one volume at a time.  An efficient scheme is to use a different
computer for each volume.
