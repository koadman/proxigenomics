###Pipeline

For work detailed in the manuscript [Deconvoluting simulated metagenomes: the performance of hard- and soft- clustering algorithms applied to metagenomic chromosome conformation capture (3C)](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1974v2), the pipeline detailed therein and used to generate the simulate dataset can be found at: [simulation/pipeline](simulation/pipeline). 

Being a single repository, you will need to clone the whole thing.
