proxigenomics
=============

Elements of Hi-C analysis, primarily intended for metagenomic samples.

###Simulation Pipeline

For work detailed in the manuscript:

[_"Deconvoluting simulated metagenomes: the performance of hard- and soft- clustering algorithms applied to metagenomic chromosome conformation capture (3C)"_](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1974v2)

- the described pipeline is contained within this repository at: [simulation/pipeline](simulation/pipeline).
- the resulting simulated dataset is publicly hosted at: http://doi.org/10.4225/59/57b0f832e013c

###Future Work
We are working on a far more user-friendly and system-agnostic replacement and hope to have a release candidate ready soon. Though is presently a *work-in-progress* please visit [meta-sweeper](https://github.com/cerebis/meta-sweeper) if you are interested.
